## Introduction to Global AI Ocean (GAIO)

**GAIO** is a community for passionate learners who are eager to learn, teach, and network. As members, we encourage you to help each other with any challenges, always making an effort to contribute. We value collaboration and learning, rather than spoon-feeding solutions. Although we don’t guarantee job placements, we believe that excellence attracts opportunities.

Each week, we will have:
- A focus topic with relevant exercises.
- Video recommendations and resources to reinforce learning.
- Assignments submitted via GitHub (don’t worry, we’ll teach you how!).

This community is a space where both learners and leaders grow together!

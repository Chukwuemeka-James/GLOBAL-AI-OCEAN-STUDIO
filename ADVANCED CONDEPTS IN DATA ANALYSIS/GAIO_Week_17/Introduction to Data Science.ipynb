    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Supervised learning is one of the fundamental paradigms of machine learning where the model learns from labeled data. The term \"supervised\" comes from the idea that the learning process is guided by a \"teacher\" in the form of labeled examples. The goal is for the model to learn patterns from past data and apply them to make predictions on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "### 1. **Labeled Data**\n",
    "   - In supervised learning, each training example consists of an **input** (features) and a corresponding **output** (label or target variable).\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     - Input: Features of a house (size, number of bedrooms, location)\n",
    "     - Output: Price of the house\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Training Process**\n",
    "   - The model is trained using a dataset where the correct output (label) is already known.\n",
    "   - The learning algorithm finds a function that maps inputs to the correct outputs with minimal error.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### 3. **Types of Supervised Learning**\n",
    "   - **Regression:** Predicts continuous values (e.g., predicting house prices).\n",
    "   - **Classification:** Predicts discrete values or categories (e.g., classifying emails as spam or not spam).\n"

    "### Intuition:\n",
    "Imagine you want to predict the price of a house. Various factors like the size, location, number of bedrooms, and condition of the house influence its price. Regression models analyze historical data (houses with known prices) and learn the relationship between these factors and price. Once trained, the model can predict the price of a new house based on its features.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns patterns from data without labeled outputs. Unlike supervised learning, where the model is trained on input-output pairs, unsupervised learning algorithms discover underlying structures, relationships, or groupings in the data without explicit guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is particularly useful when we have large amounts of data but lack labeled examples. It is widely applied in anomaly detection, market segmentation, recommendation systems, and more.\n",

    "## Key Characteristics of Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "- **No Labeled Data:** The algorithm learns patterns from raw, unclassified data.\n",
    "- **Finds Hidden Structures:** It identifies patterns, relationships, or clusters within the dataset.\n",
    "- **Self-Organizing Models:** The model structures the data without human intervention.\n",
    "- **Used for Exploratory Analysis:** It helps in understanding data distributions and hidden patterns."

    "\n",
    "#### **Key Clustering Algorithms:**\n",
    "- **K-Means Clustering**: Assigns data points to `k` clusters based on similarity.\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a tree-like hierarchy of clusters.\n",
    "- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)**: Groups points based on density and handles noise effectively.\n",
    "- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: Probabilistic model that assumes data is generated from multiple Gaussian distributions.\n",
    "\n",

    "Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to simplify high-dimensional data while preserving essential patterns. These methods help visualize and preprocess data effectively before applying further machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:**\n",

    "#### **Example Use Case:**\n",
